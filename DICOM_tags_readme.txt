Here i have made a python code which can read a .dcm file or a number of .dcm files(present in folder).

Before running the code we have to create a folder named as "DCM_FILES" in C drive(recommended and necessary to create it and place it in the C drive).

Now put all the .dcm files in the "DCM_FILES" folder.

And just run the code.


_________________________
EXPLAINATION OF THE CODE :
_________________________

first it reads the file names from the folder(i.e, DCM_FILES).

then it access each file one by one and read it.

After reading, using some inbuilt methods it gets all the tags which are present in that particular dcm files.

and then saves it in a .txt format and name it as "output_text_file.txt".

I have explained some points in the codes as well. please have a look at it then everything will be clear if you have any doubt.

Also i have attached the zip file of output text files(3 files).
